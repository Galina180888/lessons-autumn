                    In todayâ€™s digital world, an online application is one of the essential components to lead an
                    internet life. Building one such application takes more effort. From designing to developing, while
                    the work was hectic, the collaboration between the designer and developer has always been a
                    challenge, particularly when building the designed product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Figma and its plugins emerged as a one-source cutting out all the noise, such as building the entire
                    product with manual code from scratch. So, here are the top 15 Figma plugins that help you convert
                    Figma designs into HTML and CSS code snippets that can make your design-to-code journey much
                    smoother than before.
